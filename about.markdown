Hi! I'm Xufei. I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2019 and am currently working as a security engineer. I like reading good sci-fi, playing a certain MOBA, and following neat guides on the interwebs. This blog is for documenting my various shenanigans and small projects, and maybe some other things as well. Feel free to contact me via email. Thanks for visiting!
